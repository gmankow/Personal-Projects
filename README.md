## Robotics Site (in progress)
Website for Iowa States  Robotics Club using Tailwind CSS. Currently contains a main, sponsorship, and contact page. App.py currently does not run the site; to run, use the live server extension on VSCode.

## Connect 4
Built Connect 4 using programable RGB LEDs and 3d printed parts. LEDs are controlled using an Arduino that gets user inputs from the serial monitor. (a = left, d = right, s = drop piece).
